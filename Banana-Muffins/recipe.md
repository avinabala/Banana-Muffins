Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick spray or use cupcake liners.
Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set aside. 
In a large bowl or in the bowl of your stand mixer, mash the bananas. 
On medium speed, beat or whisk in the melted butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and milk (if the butter is softend instead of melted that is fine).
Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, then beat or whisk until combined. 
If adding nuts or chocolate chips, fold them in now. The batter will be thick.
Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake for about 20 minutes at 220 degrees. Insert a toothpick and if it comes out clean then the muffins are ready.
Allow the muffins to cool for atleast 5 minutes before eating
